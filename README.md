# 📚 Library Management System
## 📝 Overview
This project is a **console-based Library Management System** designed to help efficiently manage 📖 book inventories, 👥 users, and 🔄 circulation in a library environment. It provides core functionalities for ➕ adding, 📋 listing, 🔍 searching, 📥 borrowing, and 📤 returning books directly from the terminal, simulating real-world library operations with user-friendly prompts.
## 🤔 Why I Did This
- 💻 To strengthen understanding of data structures, file handling, and Java programming through practical application.
- 🏛️ To solve the problem of manual record-keeping prevalent in smaller libraries by automating routine processes in a lightweight, accessible console app.
- 🚀 To build a foundation for more complex systems by starting with robust backend logic before moving to GUI or web-based applications. 
## ⭐ Key Features
- 📚 **Book Inventory Management:** Add, remove, update, list, and search for books. 
- 👥 **User Management:** Register, list, and remove borrowers. 
- 🔄 **Borrow & Return Tracking:** Issue books to users and track their returns in a persistent manner. 
- 🖱️ **Console Menus:** Intuitive menu navigation via console prompts. 
- 💾 **Data Persistence:** Store library data in files or simple database for reliable access between sessions. 
## 🛠️ Technical Tools Used
- ☕ **Java:** Core programming language for all business logic and class design. 
- 🛠️ **JDK (Java Development Kit):** For compilation and execution of Java files. 
- 📂 **Standard Java Libraries:** Used for Input/Output streams, collections, and error handling. 
- 📄 **File Handling:** Read/write book and user data to files for persistence. 📄
## 📂 Project Structure
Typical structure:
- `LibraryManagementSystem/`
    - 📖 `Book.java` – Book model class.
    - 👤 `User.java` – User (borrower/patron) model class. 
    - 🏫 `Library.java` – Main library logic, menu, and backend operations. 
    - 🚀 `Main.java` – Entry point for running the console application.
