# 📚 Library Management System
## 📝 Overview
This project is a **console-based Library Management System** designed to help efficiently manage book inventories, users, and circulation in a library environment. It provides core functionalities for adding, listing, searching, borrowing, and returning books directly from the terminal, simulating real-world library operations with user-friendly prompts. 🖥️📖
## 🤔 Why I Did This
- To strengthen understanding of data structures, file handling, and Java programming through practical application. 💻
- To solve the problem of manual record-keeping prevalent in smaller libraries by automating routine processes in a lightweight, accessible console app. 🏛️
- To build a foundation for more complex systems by starting with robust backend logic before moving to GUI or web-based applications. 🚀
## ⭐ Key Features
- **Book Inventory Management:** Add, remove, update, list, and search for books. 📚
- **User Management:** Register, list, and remove borrowers. 👥
- **Borrow & Return Tracking:** Issue books to users and track their returns in a persistent manner. 🔄
- **Console Menus:** Intuitive menu navigation via console prompts. 🖱️
- **Data Persistence:** Store library data in files or simple database for reliable access between sessions. 💾
## 🛠️ Technical Tools Used
- **Java:** Core programming language for all business logic and class design. ☕
- **JDK (Java Development Kit):** For compilation and execution of Java files. 🛠️
- **Standard Java Libraries:** Used for Input/Output streams, collections, and error handling. 📂
- **File Handling:** Read/write book and user data to files for persistence. 📄
## 📂 Project Structure
Typical structure:
- `LibraryManagementSystem/`
    - `Book.java` – Book model class. 📖
    - `User.java` – User (borrower/patron) model class. 👤
    - `Library.java` – Main library logic, menu, and backend operations. 🏫
    - `Main.java` – Entry point for running the console application. 🚀
